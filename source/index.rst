OpenNebula Appliances
======================

OpenNebula Systems provides public and official `OpenNebula Marketplace <https://marketplace.opennebula.io/>`_, integrated and universally available to all OpenNebula deployments. It's the catalog of virtual appliances provided and certified by the OpenNebula Systems, ready to run in the OpenNebula environments. The portfolio contains a wide range of base OS appliances, virtual router appliances, and appliances with preinstalled popular services. No third-party appliances are now accepted, but you can give us feedback if missing your favorite OS appliance or service.

Follow the OpenNebula `documentation <http://docs.opennebula.io/stable/advanced_components/marketplace/market_one.html>`_ about the Marketplace integration.
