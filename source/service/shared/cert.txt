Custom SSL certificates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You may either already have valid SSL keys, either self-signed or properly signed by Certification Authority (CA) - like `Let's Encrypt <https://letsencrypt.org>`_.

If so then you can just copy-paste them during instantiation to the proper text fields:

* SSL certificate
* SSL private key
* SSL CA chain

Another option is to create your own self-signed certificate::

    $ mkdir self-signed-certs
    $ cd self-signed-certs
    $ openssl req -x509 -nodes -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout key.pem -out certificate.pem -days 365 -batch
    $ cat key.pem # copy-paste to the 'SSL private key' field
    $ cat certificate.pem # copy-paste to the 'SSL certificate' field

**IMPORTANT**: Beware that usage of a self-signed certificate is impractical for production and we will showcase it here only to demonstrate how to setup custom SSL keys! Take a look at `Let's Encrypt <https://letsencrypt.org>`_ - you can obtain valid certificates from them free of charge.
