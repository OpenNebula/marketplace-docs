* ONE service appliance is installed on top of **CentOS 7** Linux distribution
* Appliances go through three stages before they are completely deployed:

    * :ref:`install <one_service_stage_install>` - this one does not concern you - executed during image build
    * :ref:`configure <one_service_stage_configure>` - most important one - it brings service up and running
    * :ref:`bootstrap <one_service_stage_bootstrap>` - it follows the configure part and where it makes sense it spares the user of manual steps to enable the service

* More general info about appliances: :ref:`ONE service appliance <one_service_appliance>`
