Create SSH Keypair
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you don't have tre SSH key, you can create it by running:

.. prompt:: text $ auto

    $ ssh-keygen -f ~/.ssh/one

Find the private key in ``~/.ssh/one`` and the matching public key in ``~/.ssh/one.pub``. Print the generated SSH public key by:

.. prompt:: text $ auto

    $ cat ~/.ssh/one.pub

and, copy and paste the whole content into the proper form area in the OpenNebula.

    Handle your SSH keys with care! Anyone who can access your SSH private key can also log in your virtual machines!
