SSH keypair creation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you don't have any SSH key, you can create it (**RECOMMENDED**):

New SSH keypair protected with a passphrase::

    $ ssh-keygen -f $HOME/.ssh/identity

You can also create one without any protection (**NOT RECOMMENDED**) - if you just hit Enter and don't type any passphrase. Or uninteractively with this command::

    $ ssh-keygen -N "" -f $HOME/.ssh/identity

In either case your private key is ``$HOME/.ssh/identity`` and the matching public key is ``$HOME/.ssh/identity.pub``.

You can simply print the SSH pubkey::

    $ cat $HOME/.ssh/identity.pub

Copy the whole content and paste it into the proper web form.

**IMPORTANT**: Handle your private key with care - especially if you did not protect it with a passphrase. Anyone who can copy your key can use it to login to your machines!
